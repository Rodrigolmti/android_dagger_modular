There is a lot of projects that cover some subjects but in separated ways, and that make it hard to link with things that already exists. This project is some sort of frankenstein, there is a piece of various projects :D.

Goals:

- App module with minimun of code
- Each feature module has your own module
- Each feature module controls your dagger component and it's dependencies
- Navigation made easy with android navigation component and actions
